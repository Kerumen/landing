                  <p>
                    Born in 2017 TokenData is the result of an in-depth
                    reflection and long-term work. Here’s our story.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    {' '}
                    When in 2015 we started to hear about the Consensys project
                    - https://thebkp.com - it was like everything we knew
                    collapsed. We then dig into the Blockchain subject and we
                    felt like a new world was opening its doors to us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also discovered the Ethereum project, and started to
                    follow and support all the extraordinary programs that
                    happened in 2016. The rocket was launched, and more and more
                    companies started to finance themselves through ICOs. We
                    therefore had to - due to the impossibility to support all
                    new promising projects - start collecting data in the aim of
                    evaluation. At this point, we realized that the traditional
                    methods of analysis we used to know do not apply here. For
                    two reasons: 1) Ecosystem stakeholders are very different
                    from traditional investment circles and thus from
                    decision-making behaviors. 2) The data available was not
                    sufficient for the application of financial models and
                    econometric analysis acknowledged.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div className={styles.description}>
                  <p>
                    We started to focus on Big Data methodologies and more
                    specifically on artificial intelligence. Since 2017, we are
                    collecting millions of data on the Blockchain sector. For
                    this purpose, we are using the most advanced machine
                    learning technologies and try to create alpha sources of
                    alternative and derived data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These past years saw an explosion in the number of companies
                    funded through ICOs, and many of them turned out to be
                    scams. While our tools allowed us to detect them relatively
                    early, we realized that many contributors had been tempted
                    by investments in projects that would never see the light of
                    day. This type of behavior, if it lasts for too long and
                    attracts too many fraudsters, can lead to an anti-selection
                    phenomenon on the market and discourage contributors who
                    wish to support the best ICOs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That's why since the beginning of 2017 we have been working
                    on the development of a platform to spread our work to as
                    many people as possible, by offering reliable and complete
                    datasets as well as by creating and improving new indicators
                    to allow the eco-system of the Blockchain to grow even
                    faster.
